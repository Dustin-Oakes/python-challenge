    "# In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company.\n",
    "# You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv).\n",
    "# The dataset is composed of two columns: \"Date\" and \"Profit/Losses\". (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  - The total number of months included in the dataset\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  - The net total amount of \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  - The changes in \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Your analysis should look similar to the following:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  ```text\n",
    "#  Financial Analysis\n",

    "#  Total Months: 86\n",

    "#  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)\n",
    "#  ```\n",
